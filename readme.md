# Driver Drowsiness Detection

This project accepts photos of people driving vehicles and tells whether they are alert enough to drive safely. 
  
  
# Packages used

python v3.8  
tensorflow v2.5  
keras v2.2. 5  
OpenCv v4.5.2  
numpy v1.21.0  
pandas v1.2.4  
matplotlib v3.4.2  
seaborn v0.11.1  
tqdm v4.61.1  
scikit-learn v0.24.2 
Out of these you only need tensorflow and keras for predictions.  

# Dataset
The datatset being used to train the model is taken from kaggle.  
You can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dheerajperumandla/drowsiness-dataset)  
The dataset consists of 2900 total images of mouths that are open, closed, yawning and not yawning.  


# Instructions

If you want to train the model, run all the cells in DriverDrowsiness.ipynb  
To use the model on predictions on your own images, load the dataset from appropriate cell and then run the prediction code on your own image  
(further instructions commented in notebooks)
